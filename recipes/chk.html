                The Famous Chicken Alfredo

                These are some pasta, more like Fettuccine. <br>
                But the magic goes on the sauce. <br>
                We moved to Italy, specifically to Rome in 1914 <br>
                when the cook Alfredo Di Lelio prepared his wife <br>
                a dish of semolina fettuccine <br>
                and seasoned it with butter and grated <br> 
                Parmigiano Reggiano cheese. <br>
                This delicious creation not only delighted his wife, <br> 
                but also suggested <br>
                that he add them to the menu at her restaurant.

                    Now let's prepare it!
                </h2>
                <li>
                    <p>Boil a pot of water and cook the fettuccine pasta according to the package instructions. Drain
                        and set aside.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Season the chicken strips with salt and pepper.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the seasoned chicken
                        strips and cook until they are no longer pink in the center, usually about 5-6 minutes per side.
                        Once cooked, remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>In the same skillet, add another tablespoon of olive oil if needed. Saut√© the minced garlic until
                        fragrant, for about 1-2 minutes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Lower the heat and pour in the heavy cream, stirring continuously. Allow it to simmer gently for
                        about 2-3 minutes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Gradually add the grated Parmesan cheese to the cream sauce, stirring constantly until the cheese
                        melts and the sauce thickens.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Add the cooked fettuccine pasta to the sauce, tossing gently to coat the pasta evenly.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Add the cooked chicken strips back into the skillet with the pasta and sauce. Stir gently to
                        combine everything together.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Add the butter to the skillet and continue to toss the pasta until the butter melts and
                        incorporates into the sauce.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Once everything is well combined and heated through, remove from heat. Serve the Chicken Alfredo
                        hot, garnished with chopped parsley if desired.</p>
