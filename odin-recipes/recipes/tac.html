            <li>
                <p>Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.</p>
            </li>

                    minute.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add the ground beef or chicken to the skillet. Break it up with a spoon and cook until it's browned
                    and cooked through.</p>
