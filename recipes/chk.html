            The Famous Chicken Alfredo
        </h1>

        <p>
            These are some pasta, more like Fettuccine. <br>
            But the magic goes on the sauce.
            We moved to Italy, specifically to Rome in 1914 <br> 
            when the cook Alfredo Di Lelio prepared his wife a dish of semolina fettuccine <br> 
            and seasoned it with butter and grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese. <br>
            This delicious creation not only delighted his wife, but also suggested <br>
            that he add them to the menu at her restaurant.

            Now let's prepare it!
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Boil a pot of water and cook the fettuccine pasta according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</p></li>
            <li><p>Season the chicken strips with salt and pepper.</p></li>
            <li><p>Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the seasoned chicken strips and cook until they are no longer pink in the center, usually about 5-6 minutes per side. Once cooked, remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</p></li>
            <li><p>In the same skillet, add another tablespoon of olive oil if needed. Saut√© the minced garlic until fragrant, for about 1-2 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><p>Lower the heat and pour in the heavy cream, stirring continuously. Allow it to simmer gently for about 2-3 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><p>Gradually add the grated Parmesan cheese to the cream sauce, stirring constantly until the cheese melts and the sauce thickens.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add the cooked fettuccine pasta to the sauce, tossing gently to coat the pasta evenly.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add the cooked chicken strips back into the skillet with the pasta and sauce. Stir gently to combine everything together.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add the butter to the skillet and continue to toss the pasta until the butter melts and incorporates into the sauce.</p></li>
            <li><p>Once everything is well combined and heated through, remove from heat. Serve the Chicken Alfredo hot, garnished with chopped parsley if desired.</p></li>
