                    Now let's prepare it!
                </h2>
                <li>
                    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Boil a large pot of salted water and cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions.
                        Drain and set aside.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>In a large skillet or saucepan, cook the ground beef or Italian sausage over medium heat until
                        browned. Add chopped onion and minced garlic. Cook until the onion is translucent.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer
                        the
                        sauce for about 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld. Set aside.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese with one beaten egg. Mix until well combined.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Assemble the lasagna: In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom.
                        Place a
                        layer of lasagna noodles on top, slightly overlapping. Spread half of the ricotta mixture over
                        the
                        noodles, followed by a sprinkle of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Add another layer of meat
                        sauce.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Repeat the layers: noodles, remaining ricotta mixture, mozzarella, Parmesan, and meat sauce. Top
                        with
                        a final layer of noodles and the remaining meat sauce. Sprinkle the top generously with
                        mozzarella
                        and Parmesan cheese.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 25-30 minutes or until the cheese is bubbly
                        and
                        golden brown.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Once baked, allow the lasagna to cool for about 10-15 minutes before slicing. Garnish with fresh
                        basil or parsley if desired. Serve and enjoy!</p>
